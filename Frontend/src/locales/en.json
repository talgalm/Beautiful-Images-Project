To allow us to arrive at a reliable assessment of the beauty of the images, we ask that you view at least 70 images and give each of them a score that expresses How much do you like them? In our estimation, the time required is about 10 minutes. <br/>The research is anonymous. We are interested in statistical data and not in personal data, so we do not collect any details about you. We would be happy if you later answer some demographic questions, but It's not mandatory, all you need is an email address so we can allow you to enter the system.",
