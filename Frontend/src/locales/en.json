To allow us to arrive at a reliable assessment of the beauty of the images, we ask that you view at least 70 images and give each of them a score that expresses How much do you like them? In our estimation, the time required is about 10 minutes. <br/>The research is anonymous. We are interested in statistical data and not in personal data, so we do not collect any details about you. We would be happy if you later answer some demographic questions, but It's not mandatory, all you need is an email address so we can allow you to enter the system.",

    "generalInstructions": "Now we will show you all 70 images in a window when they are reduced. Hovering the mouse over each image will enlarge it a little, and clicking with the mouse on the image will enlarge it further. The scores for each image are given by dragging it to the appropriate cell on the right side of the screen. The system allows you to transfer images from one cell to another, until you feel that the grades for all the images do reflect your taste. We recommend that there be a similar (not necessarily the same) amount of images in the different grade cells. Basically, the more you like the image, the higher it should be in the cell with a higher score. For example, if you really like the picture, give it a score of 9 or 10. If you like it but not completely, give it a score of 7 or 8. And vice versa: give a score of 1 or 2 to pictures you don't like at all, and so on. After you finish rating the 70 images, you can choose between the option of seeing more images and rating them or end your participation.",
